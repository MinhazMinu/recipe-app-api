###### Common testing issues

-   Test not running
    -   May be you missed \_\_init\_\_.py file in tests/ directory
    -   Missing test prefix _test\__ for method
    -   indentation of test cases
-   ImportError when running test
    -   Usually it happened when tests/ directory & tests.py both exist.
